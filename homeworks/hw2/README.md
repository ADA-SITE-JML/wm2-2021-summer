##### In my project, I have two entities that are Films-Actors and have a many-to-many relationship. 
###### In one of the main pages, called "Films", you can:

* find list of all the movies added to the database
* search for films by their categories (added by a non-native query) 
* search for films with more actors than the number you specified in the field (added by a native query)
* add new movies by clicking the “Add “a New Film” button and entering their information
* read detailed information about the films by clicking the "Click for More Info" button
* From there, edit and delete existing movie information
* add and remove actors from the listed films (you can add  several actors for one film)

###### All of the above mentioned operations can also be performed on the "Actors" page. Additionally, in order to handle my errors, I added an error page. For convenience, I've also added Films, Actors, and Return  Back buttons on the pages to make it easier to navigate from one page to another.
