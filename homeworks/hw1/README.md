## Hi, I am Fagan Rasulov


##### What my jsp do:
* There are courses in the courses.txt file which is located in DB folder.
* When you open index.jsp page, it reads all data from file to Course Arraylist
* When you search, it searchs query from courses Arraylist.
	* If query is "all", it will show all courses.
	* It checks, title and instructor fields with java.util.String.contains function
* If query is nothing it will raise exception and error page will be opened


#### Requirements
* I have added bootstrap css link which will require internet.
* Please, change file name in the index.jsp folder, for your file location.
* Please, use hw1 as a app name. I have used /hw1/ as a action in form get request.
